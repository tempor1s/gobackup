## Milestones

- [ ] Clone a single repository to your computer through CLI.
- [ ] Clone multiple repositories to local computer
- [ ] Clone multiple reposiories using concurrency
- [ ] Upload cloned repositories to other services like GitLab or BitBucket
- [ ] Do the above concurrently
- [ ] Do the reverse, pull repos from BitBucket / GitLab and clone them or upload them to GitHub. Ideally want to be platform agnostic.
